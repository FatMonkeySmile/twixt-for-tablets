TwixT is a two-player abstract game invented by Alex Randolph.  Each player tries to link their sides of the board while blocking their opponent.
 This is done by placing pegs which create links with other pegs if they are a &quot;knights move&quot; apart and not blocked by an opposing link. 
 A knights move is two spaces either up, down, left or right, then one space perpendicular as shown in the image above.<!--  To place pegs in this version, drag your finger 
 from the starting area onto the board. The peg will be offset by the starting distance from where you first touched the screen, making it easier to see the 
 board as you place your peg.-->  For more information about the game visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TwixT">TwixT entry on Wikipedia</a>.
